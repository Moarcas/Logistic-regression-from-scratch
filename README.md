A logistic regression classifier that recognize cats

The code implements a logistic regression model using gradient descent optimization to classify images as either cat or non-cat. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of cat and non-cat images, and its performance is evaluated on both the training and test sets. The code also includes a function to plot the learning curve, showing the cost function over iterations.
The code uses a dataset of cat and non-cat images. The dataset is stored in two separate files: train_catvnoncat.h5 (training set) and test_catvnoncat.h5 (test set). Each file contains a matrix of flattened image data and corresponding labels.
